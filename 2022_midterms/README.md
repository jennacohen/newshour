# PBS NewsHour: 2022 Midterm Election

For the 2022 Midterm elections, my projects focused on candidates that would have influence or control over elections and whether [our team classified](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/election-denier-doubter-or-defender-heres-our-analysis-of-some-gop-candidates) them as an election denier, doubter or defender.

I contributed to the design of our election results pages, an election guide newsletter and wrote two data-driven stories on secretaries of state:
